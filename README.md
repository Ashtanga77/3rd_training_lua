## Frame data database
For the script to function at its best, we need to enter specific frame data for every character and every move into the script database.
When a character frame data is correctly entered in the database, it allows the script to make any opponent dummy successfully block/parry/red parry the corresponding move. Otherwise, the script will fall back to a default frame data, that may not match the actual move properties.
Here is a list of character/moves that has been done so far.
### Done characters
