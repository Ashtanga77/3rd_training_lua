# 3rd_training_lua
Training mode for Street Fighter III 3rd Strike (USA 990512), on FBA-RR v0.7 emulator

The right version of FBA-RR can be downloaded [here](http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/Fbarr.html)

## Main features
- Can set dummy to counter-attack with any move on frame 1 after any hit / block / parry / wake-up
- Can record and replay sequences into 8 different slots
- Can replay sequences randomly and as counter-attack

## Roadmap
[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/UQ8ey2rQ/3rdtraining)

## Missing features
Automatic blocking needs some manual setup to be done by character in order to work correctly, so a lot of characters do not support this feature yet. Every missing character is mentioned on the Roadmap though and will be added at some point.

## Bug reporting / Contribute
This training mode is still in development and you may encounter bugs or missing features while using it. Please report anything weird thing on the [issues page](https://github.com/Grouflon/3rd_training_lua/issues)
If you wish to contribute or give any feedback, feel free to get in touch with me or submit pull requests.
