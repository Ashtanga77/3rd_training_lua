# 3rd_training_lua
Training mode for Street Fighter III 3rd Strike (USA 990512), on FBA-RR v0.0.7 emulator

The right version of FBA-RR can be downloaded [here](http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/Fbarr.html)

## Main features
- Can set dummy to counter-attack with any move on frame 1 after any hit / block / parry / wake-up
- Can record and replay sequences into 8 different slots
- Can replay sequences randomly and as counter-attack
- Can save/load recorded sequences to/from files
- Can display hit/hurt/throwboxes
- Can display input history for both players

## How to use
* Download emulator from [here](http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/Fbarr.html) and find the proper roms
* Download script from [here](https://github.com/Grouflon/3rd_training_lua/archive/master.zip) or clone repository
* Extract script anywhere on your computer
* Start the emulator, load the rom, start a match with P1 and P2 (you will need to map input for both players)
* Go to Game->Lua Scripting->New Lua Script Window and run the script **3rd_training.lua** from here
* Follow instructions from Output Console

## Troubleshooting
**Q: Missing rom, zip file not found**

A: Make sure you have the proper roms. You must have at least 2 roms: _sfiii3.zip_ and _sfiii3a.zip_. sfiii3 is the japanese version and the zip contains _sfiii3_japan_nocd.29f400.u2_. sfiiia is the american version and contains _sfiii3_usa.29f400.u2_.

You may need to rename zip files so they match exactly what the emulator expect for.

**Q: Emulator crash when I run lua script**

A: Check video settings, you musn't use "Enhanced" blitter option.

**Q: UI looks weird and hitboxes are misplaced**

A: Check video settings, you must use "Basic" blitter option with no scanlines if you want the UI to work properly.

**Q: Emulator doesn't run at all, there's a missing dll**

A: Install prerequires from [here](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk-Prereqs/releases/latest/)

## Roadmap
[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/UQ8ey2rQ/3rdtraining)

## Missing features
Automatic blocking needs some manual setup to be done by character in order to work correctly, so a lot of characters do not support this feature yet. Every missing character is mentioned on the Roadmap though and will be added at some point.

## Bug reporting / Contribute
This training mode is still in development and you may encounter bugs or missing features while using it. Please report anything weird on the [issues page](https://github.com/Grouflon/3rd_training_lua/issues)
